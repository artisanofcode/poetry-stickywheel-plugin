# Poetry StickyWheel Plugin

<p class="lead">
A poetry plugin to pin version dependencies when building packages with local folder dependencies.
</p>

## 🛠 Installing

```
poetry self add poetry-stickywheel-plugin
```

## 📚 Help

This plugin will rewrite folder dependencies in your poetry projects dependencies with version dependencies.

The version will be extracted from the dependencies pyproject.toml and applied as a semver match.

Assuming a `pyproject.toml` such as:

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "a"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = []
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
b = {path = "../b", develop = true}
```

and the dependency `pyproject.toml`

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "b"
version = "1.2.3"
description = ""
authors = []
readme = "README.md"
```

the dependency will be rewritten as if it had been defined as:

```
b = "^1.2.3"
```

## Configuration

You can define a section in your `pyproject.toml` file named `tool.stickywheel`, to configure various options.

### Dependency constraint strategy

The default strategy is `semver` (described in the "Help" section above), but there are other choices:

| strategy  | version | result    |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `semver`  | `1.2.3` | `^1.2.3`  |
| `minimum` | `1.2.3` | `>=1.2.3` |
| `exact`   | `1.2.3` | `1.2.3`   |

To override the default, add `strategy` to the configuration. For example:

```toml
[tool.stickywheel]
strategy = "exact"
```
